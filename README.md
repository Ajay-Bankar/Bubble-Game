# Bubble Game Project

This is a simple bubble popping game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a timer, score tracking, and dynamic changing of the bubble's position whenever it's clicked.

## Features
- Timer: The game has a countdown timer which starts at 60 seconds. Once the timer reaches 0, the game ends.
- Score: Players earn points by clicking on the bubble. Each click increases the score by one.
- Dynamic Bubble: Whenever the user clicks on the bubble, its position changes randomly within the game container.

## Technologies Used
- HTML: Markup language used for structuring the web page.
- CSS: Stylesheet language used for styling the web page elements.
- JavaScript: Programming language used for implementing game logic and interactivity.

## Files
- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the game.
- `styles.css`: Stylesheet file for styling the game elements.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the game logic.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Click on the bubble to start the game.
3. Keep clicking on the bubble to increase your score before the timer runs out.
4. The bubble's position changes randomly whenever it's clicked.
5. Once the timer reaches 0, the game ends, and your final score is displayed.
